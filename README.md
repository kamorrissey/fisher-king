Blender 3D models and animations of the Fisher King interstellar freighter from my novel Fisher King: Percival's Descent

The general shape of the Fisher king is a cylinder 150 feet in diameter and about a mile long,
with a 300 foot diamater sphere at either end.
The backstory for the shape is that the means of FTL travel used favors shapes that are long and narrow
over those that are fat.

The front sphere is the primary crew ad operations module. The rear sphere is engineering and houses the powerplant.
The long cylinder is the cargo hold. It has exterior ribs for structural support and to aid the FTL system.

A 10-foot diameter hole runs through the long axis of the ship. It is another oddity of the FTL system.
